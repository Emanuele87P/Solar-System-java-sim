# Solar-System-java-sim
A small program simulating part of the Solar System using java.awt.Canvas

I first created this program out of a template we made in school.
Then I added the class Pianeta.java to make the planets and implemented a piece of code to make them rotate.
Simple program, run it and have fun.
